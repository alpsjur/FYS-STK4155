We use a neural network (NN) and logistic regression (LR) to classify the 2005 Taiwan credit card data.
There are two categories: non-default and default. A comparison is made between
the two methods, and we find that the NN yields the highest accuracy score 0.823 compared with 0.820
from the LR algorithm.
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was also used as a performance measure, the NN producing the highest score of 0.782, compared with 0.765 from logistic regression. The highest accuracy and AUC were found from different hyperparameters respectively. We also produced a confusion matrix, which showed that NN classified more true positives and true negatives correctly than LR.
In terms of efficiency, the LR algorithm converges quite rapidly compared to the NN, and is overall
more stable, possibly due to an implementation of dynamic learning rate.
Furthermore, we use the NN to fit Franke's function (with noise), and compare this to linear regression algorithms used in our earlier paper. Our findings suggest that the neural network achieved the lowest MSE of $0.011$, and a R2 score of $0.89$.
