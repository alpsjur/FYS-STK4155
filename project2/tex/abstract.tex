We use a Neural Network (NN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to classify the 2005 Taiwan credit card data.
There are two categories: non-default and default. A comparison is made between
the two methods, and we find that the NN yields the highest accuracy score (HER) compared with (HER)
from the LR algorithm.
Area ratio was also used as a performance measure, the NN producing the highest score of (HER).
In terms of efficiency, the LR algorithm converges quite rapidly compared to the NN, and is overall
more stable, possibly due to an implementation of dynamic learning rate.
Furthermore, we use the NN to fit the Franke function (with noise), and compare this to linear
regression algorithms used in our earlier paper. Our findings suggest that
