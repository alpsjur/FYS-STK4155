\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We studied classification and regression using a neural network and logistic regression
algorithm. For classification we used the 2005 Taiwan credit card data,
and for regression we fitted the Franke function. In both cases, the neural network
was compared to other methods: logistic and linear regression, respectively.
To compare methods we used the accuracy and ROC AUC score functions for classification,
and R2 and MSE for regression. For classification, we found that the neural network gave
the highest accuracy of HER, slightly higher than logistic regression, which had a
accuracy of HER. As for the ROC AUC score, the neural network also performed better
with a score of HER. In general, the LR algorithm seemed to converge faster compared to
the neural network, although no formal analysis was made.

As for regression, we found that the MSE
