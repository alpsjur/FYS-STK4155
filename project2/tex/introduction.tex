\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs) offer a flexible way of performing data analysis, and can be used
for tasks such as classification and regression.

In this article, we will study the 2005 Taiwan credit card data set with the purpose
of classifying risky/non-risky credit card holders. For this we will use a ANN as well as the LR method.
Furthermore, we will try to model the Franke function with randomised noise using a ANN.
