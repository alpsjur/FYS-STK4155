In this paper we use a neural network approach for solving the diffusion equation and compare this with a traditional finite difference approach using Forward Euler and Centered Difference methods. We also find the eigenpairs of a real symmetric matrix using a similar neural network approach. Our findings show that neural networks can be used to solve partial differential equations. Compared with a traditional approach, we find that the neural network can achieve a lower MSE of about 2-3 orders of magnitude, but is in general 3 orders of magnitude slower. We also looked at the effect of learning rate on MSE.
