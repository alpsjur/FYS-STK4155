In Figure \ref{fig:FDcompare} two different instants in the time evolution of the diffusion equation (eq. \ref{eq:diffusionEQ}), as obtained from finite difference methods, are shown. For both, a comparison is made with the exact solution and a run with higher spatial resolution. In both cases, the graphs are difficult to distinguish, except for the lower resolution run, which is not as smooth.

Likewise, in Figure \ref{fig:NNcompare} we show a parallell to Figure \ref{fig:FDcompare} with solutions from a neural network. In this case, we also see agreement between the computed and exact solutions for both points in time.

Shown in Figure \ref{fig:MSEbench} are the MSE's for two instants in time for both finite difference methods and a neural network. For the finite difference methods we observe a decrease in MSE for increasing temporal solution, slowing down after around 500 time points for both cases. For $t=0.02$ s (a.), the MSE is minimal at around $10^{-6}$ for 1000 time points, while for $t=0.3$ s (c.) it only becomes around $10^{-5}$ for 1000 time points.

For the neural network, we observe a decrease in MSE for an increasing number of iterations. In the case of $t=0.02$ s (b.), we see that the MSE decreases below $10^{-8}$ after around 6000 iterations, with a further, but slight, decrease at 10000 iterations. As for $t=0.3$ s (d.), the MSE is below $10^{-8}$ after around 4000 iterations and is mostly unchanged afterwards.

Comparison between the finite difference methods and the neural network, we see that the neural network can obtain an MSE 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the finite difference methods.

Likewise, on the right-hand side (b., d.) the MSE's yielded from the neural network are shown as a function of iterations with network parameters $N_t = 10$, $N_x = 100$, and $\gamma = 0.004$.}

Accompanying Figure \ref{fig:MSEbench}, we show the CPU times as a function of temporal resolution and number of iterations, respectively, for the different scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:CPUbench}. We see that the general curve is very similar for all scenarios. For the CD/FE method, we see that the CPU time becomes slightly longer for shorter t at 1000 time points. The neural network looks to have the same curve in both b. and d.

Comparing the two methods, we see that the neural network is around 3 orders of magnitude, if not more, slower than the finite difference methods.
