## Contents
This repository contains the following:

* **code**
 *  class - contains the file *projectfunctions* that constains various functions used throughout the project.
 * various scripts that contains the  different methods, benchmarking, and code for plotting the results. The code for 
 plotting the eigenvalue evolution can be found in nn_eigenvalue.py.

* **data**
 * eigenvectors - the time evolution of the max and min eigenvectors.
 * pde - the output from the benchmarking of the solvers used for the diffusion equation.

* **figures**

 * figures produced by the plotting script

* **tex**
 * all the latex files making up the report. For the report itself, please see: *tex/main.pdf*.
