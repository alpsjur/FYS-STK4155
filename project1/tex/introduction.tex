The use of machine learning for problem solving has risen in popularity as large data sets have become available for analysis. There now exists many different methods in varying complexity for both supervised and unsupervised learning. All of these methods have advantages and drawbacks, as well as many similarities. This means we can get familiar with some of the central themes in machine learning by studying simple algorithms.

In this report, we will implement three different supervised learning algorithms with increasing complexity, as well as the k-fold resampling technique.
