We evaluate the ordinary least squares(OLS), Ridge, and Lasso regression algorithms for fitting a 2D polynomial to the Franke function, as well as real terrain data over the inner Oslo fjord in Norway. For the Franke function, we find that Ridge yields the smallest mean square error (MSE) for degree m=9 hyper parameter $\lambda$ = 1e-5
