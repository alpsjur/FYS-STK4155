We evaluate the ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge, and Lasso regression algorithms for fitting a 2D polynomial to Franke's function, as well as real terrain data over the inner Oslo fjord in Norway. Studying first Franke's function, we can identify the bias-variance trade-off when resampling, and find it consistent with theory. Comparing methods, we find that the Ridge algorithm yields the smallest mean square error (MSE) of $0.014$. As for the terrain data, we identify no bias-variance trade-off, possibly due to the complexity of the data. We find that OLS performs better with a MSE of around 2000. Furthermore, we observe that both the Ridge and Lasso algorithms seem to converge to the OLS solution for smaller hyperparameters.
