# Using linear regression for fitting terrain data
### Project 1 for FYS-STK4150 at University of Oslo, Fall 2019

The files *Project1* and *rapportstruktur* are instructions on how to complete the project.

Our answer is presented in the following folders:

1. tex

 All the latex code for the project report. For the finished report, see *main.pdf* or click [here](https://github.com/janadr/FYS-STK4155/blob/master/project1/tex/main.pdf)

2. code

 All the programs used in the project, written in python 3.6. The programs are the following:

 * projectfunctions.py - all the functions needed to compute the different regressions and resamplings
 * plottingfunctions.py - functions used for plotting the data produced by *projectfunctions*
 * produce_figures.py - produce all the figures for the results of Franke's function
 * iofunctions.py - functions for doing calculations related to the project and writing the results to be stored in files.
 * generate_realdata.py - produce .txt files with results using *projectfunctions* and *iofunctions*
 * plot_realdata.py - produce figures for the results of the real data.

3. data

 Contains all the data used in the project. Both the real data and our regression-produced data.

4. figures

 All figures in the report, mainly graphs displaying the behaviour of the different regression methods.
